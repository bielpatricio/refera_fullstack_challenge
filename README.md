# Refera - Fullstack Code Challenge

This project was proposed by the refer group as a challenge. The goal of this challenge is to create a web application to manage maintanence orders from Refera, following the Acceptance criteria. The frontend of application a page to list all orders and the backend contains a simple REST API service and has a connection to a database.

- [go to How run the program?](https://github.com/bielpatricio/refera_fullstack_challenge/blob/master/README.md#how-does-the-program-work)

# How run the program?
  1. The first step is to clone the project somewhere on your machine: `git clone https://github.com/bielpatricio/refera_fullstack_challenge.git`;
  2. For the next step it is necessary to have docker running and preferably open;
  3. Now access the terminal inside the project folder;
  4. Enter the server folder (`cd server`) and type the following command: `docker compose up --build`;
  5. Now that the backend is running, go back to the project's root folder (`cd ..`), go to the web folder (`cd web`) and type the following command: `npm run dev`;
  
  Now front and back is running on your machine.
  To access the application, just go to a browser and access the page: http://localhost:3000/
  
  Obs: Once step 4 is done, the docker images will already be created on your machine, to run them again, just run the command `docker compose up` inside the server folder. No need --build.

## How does the program work?
  A main page was built that will list some orders. To optimize the loading time, a paging system was implemented in the API, so if the amount of data in the database is very large, it doesn't take long to load the page, so the program will show every 8 orders. To access the other orders, you need to click on the lower right button and that way you will access the next 8 orders in the database, and to go back to the previous 8 orders just click on the lower left button that will appear on the screen.
  Still on the initial screen we have some functionalities available, one of them is to click on the button `Open new order` that will open a modal to create a new order in the database, all fields are mandatory. In the `select categories` category options that exist in the database will appear, to create more options or delete some, just make an HTTP request referring to the category routes that are listed below, and you will have available to create your order with the new category.
  To show more knowledge of reactJS, a route system was created on the front-end, where when you click on one of the orders on the home page, you are redirected to a page where you will have detailed information about the selected order. In addition to the information, the page also has a button in the upper right corner (inside the field) that allows you to delete the order. To return to the initial page, one of the options is to click on the reference icon in the upper left corner, it will always redirect to the application's initial page.
  
## Server
  The back-end was created in django, a system used by the company Refera. The backend was created to support the challenge requirements:
  
  1. RESTful API allowing CRUD and list operations on the orders
     - Endpoint to create/retrieve/update/delete order
     - Endpoint to list order
  2. RESTful API allowing CRUD operations on the categories
    - Endpoint to create/retrieve/update/delete category
    - Endpoint to list categories
  3. Database to store data from the following resources
    - Order
    - Category
   
  ### Order
   For the order, 5 routes were created:
   
    1. List all the orders in the database, 
      where the page variable can be passed in the params that will pick up the orders according to Pagination
      -> `http://localhost:8000/orders?page=2`, (GET)
    
    2. Get order by id, which will get the details of a specific order -> `http://localhost:8000/orders/12`, (GET)
    
    3. Create order, which will create a new order -> `http://localhost:8000/orders`, (POST)
      3.1 body ->
      
      ```
      
      {
            "id": 18,
            "category_id": 6,
            "name": "Caio Victor",
            "phone": "83995412369",
            "estateAgency": "Desenvolvimento",
            "description": "Desenvolvendo app para o sistema de monitoramento de bugs",
            "company": "Refera",
            "deadline": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z"
        }
        
        ```
  
    4. Delete order by id, which will delete the order -> `http://localhost:8000/orders/12`, (DELETE)
    
    5. Update order, which will change the specified new order -> `http://localhost:8000/orders`, (PATCH)
      5.1 body ->
      
      ```
      
      {
            "id": 18,
            "category_id": 2,
            "name": "Caio Victor Amaral",
            "phone": "83995412369",
            "estateAgency": "Desenvolvimento",
            "description": "Desenvolvendo app",
            "company": "Refera",
            "deadline": "2024-08-01T00:00:00Z"
        }
        
        ```

## WEB
  The front-end stop was made in reactJS and styled-components, as mentioned before there are two routes to '/' to the home page where the orders are listed and the create order is done, and the route '/:orderId', where orderId represents the Id of the selected order, this page will show the details of the order. The layout was created based on the challenge specification diagram. The material-ui library was used for the icons. Below are some screenshots of the running application.
